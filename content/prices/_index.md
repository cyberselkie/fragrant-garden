## How to Commission Me

*If you message me on Twitter or Discord for the actual commission, you will be redirected to my email.*

You do not have to email me and ask if my commissions are open. If I cannot take your work on now, I'll let you know when I can. Send everything in the initial email!

### Payment
Payment is done via PayPal invoice. Usually half upfront and half upon completion.

### Requirements 
Before you email me, have a moodboard and general references for what you want, whether this is for one image or for a series of images. All of a moodboard, general pose reference, and style reference (from some of my own artwork), and a text description is preferred.


#### Style Reference - Required
I can draw in a few ways with varying levels of effort. Link the art of mine that caught your eye, the style you would like me to draw in, so that I can evaluate the time it will take and quote accordingly.

#### Text Description - Required
This depends on whether or not you want me to take a great deal of artistic liberties or not. If you have a specific image in mind, you'll want to add a text description with those details. If you want to give me what is essentially a prompt and see what I come up with, you can do that, too.

#### Moodboard - Optional
This can be a pinterest or an image comprised of multiple images that convey the aesthetic qualities and references you would like me to invoke in the art. If you don't know what a moodboard is, there are many examples online.

#### Pose Reference - Optional
This can be a photograph or a drawing you made - even an MS Paint mouse drawing is great, especially if it's labeled with the details you would like. I would prefer that pose references are **NOT** the art of others, but you may link my own art if you would like a similar pose. If you want me to take artistic liberties, then you do not have to include a pose reference. However, changing the entire pose of the drawing will incur a much higher revision fee because it takes me some time to pose a sketch.
